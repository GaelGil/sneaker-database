## What I Did
I created a frontend to compare sneaker prices by looking at the data to see where it is more convinient to buy. This was a fun project for me seeing as how one of my other passions is sneakers. This is a project I can actually use in my personal life when buying sneakers. 

## How I did it
I found the [sneaks-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sneaks-api) and thought it was a super cool tool. This node module is what I used to get the sneaker data neede for the project. I just created a frontend to better visualize prices. I saw that the creator made a price checker but I noticed that it was too much information all at once. I deicided I wanted to use the scraper to display more useful data and make a more custom frontend. I wanted to display data that I would want to look at personaly when I would be buying sneakers.

## The Process
Initially I wanted to display a line chart of the prices of a sneaker and how they change through time. This would give the user an idea of where and when prices are more expensive. I eventually got to this point by collecting the data every other week and storing it in a model server on the google cloud platform. That was the intial idea. These models as I mentioned were on google cloud and so was the site itsself. However my credits ran out for google cloud. I have sinced removed the models and that data is no longer available. You can only compare the sneaker prices. I have also moved to heroku.

## Where It Can Be Found
I am now hosting it on heroku [here](https://sneaker-prices.herokuapp.com/). Heres some images:
